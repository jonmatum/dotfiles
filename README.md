# Just Another Dotfiles Repository (2023 Update)

Welcome to just another dotfiles repository, though it's anything but ordinary. This repository is a testament to my journey in customizing and optimizing development environments. After several years working solely on macOS and GNU/Linux, I have recently made my return to the Windows ecosystem. Thanks to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), I've found an unparalleled sense of satisfaction, as it allows me to tailor everything exactly to my needs and aesthetic preferences.

Housed in this repository are my carefully crafted dotfiles that contain an array of settings and configurations, streamlining the task of recreating my ideal workspace across macOS, GNU/Linux, and WSL.
