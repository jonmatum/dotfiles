# Vim Configuration (vimrc) Readme

Welcome to the Vim Configuration (vimrc) setup! This readme will guide you on how to get started with this vimrc configuration and provide any necessary pre-steps to get it working.

## Pre-Steps

Before getting started, please ensure that you have Vim installed on your system. You can check if Vim is installed by opening a terminal and running the following command:

```bash
vim --version
```

If Vim is not installed, you can install it using your system's package manager or by downloading it from the official Vim website: [https://www.vim.org](https://www.vim.org).

## Getting Started

To get started with this vimrc configuration, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.vimrc` file:
   ```bash
   wget 
   ```
   Alternatively, you can manually download the `.vimrc` file and save it to your home directory.

2. Navigate to the downloaded/cloned repository or the directory where you saved the `.vimrc` file:
   ```bash
   cd vimrc
   ```

3. Copy the `.vimrc` file to your home directory:
   ```bash
   cp .vimrc ~/
   ```

4. Launch Vim by running the `vim` command in your terminal.

5. Vim will load the configuration from the `.vimrc` file in your home directory, applying the custom settings and plugins.

## Customizing the Configuration

The provided `.vimrc` file is a starting point, but you can customize it to suit your preferences. Here are a few ways you can modify the configuration:

- **Adding Plugins:** The `.vimrc` file uses the Vim-Plug plugin manager to manage plugins. To add new plugins, open the `.vimrc` file in a text editor, locate the `Plug` section, and add the plugin's details following the provided examples.

- **Customizing Keybindings:** If you prefer different keybindings or want to add your own, you can modify the `.vimrc` file to define your preferred mappings. Look for the section labeled "Mappings" in the `.vimrc` file and make the necessary changes.

- **Changing Colorschemes:** The `.vimrc` file sets the default colorscheme to "codedark". If you want to change the colorscheme, find the line that sets the colorscheme and replace "codedark" with the name of the colorscheme you prefer.

Remember to save the changes to the `.vimrc` file and restart Vim for the modifications to take effect.
