Certainly! Here's a README for the configuration file along with instructions on how to get started:

# Tmux Configuration

This repository contains a custom configuration file for Tmux, a terminal multiplexer. The configuration provides various enhancements and keybindings to improve your Tmux experience.

## Getting Started

To use this Tmux configuration, follow the steps below:

1. Install Tmux if you haven't already. You can typically install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install tmux
   ```

2. Download the raw `tmux.conf` file from this repository by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...). Save the file to your local machine.

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the URL.

3. Copy the configuration file (`tmux.conf`) to your home directory:
   ```
   cp tmux-config/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

4. Install the Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
   ```

5. Launch Tmux using the new configuration:
   ```
   tmux
   ```

## Keybindings and Features

Here are some keybindings and features provided by this Tmux configuration:

- Vim-like keybindings for pane navigation (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
- Use `Ctrl-h` and `Ctrl-l` to switch between windows.
- Shift + arrow keys to resize panes.
- Mouse support is enabled.
- The status bar shows useful information, such as session name, username, hostname, and current working directory.
- Prefix key is set to `Ctrl-a`.
- Open a new vertical split with `prefix + v`.
- Open a new horizontal split with `prefix + h`.
- Create a new window in the current directory with `prefix + c`.
- Confirm and kill the current window with `prefix + k`.
- Quickly edit a todo list with `prefix + t`.
- The configuration includes several useful plugins like Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM), Tmux Sensible, and Tmux Open.

## Starting Tmux with a Predefined Session and Window

If you'd like to start Tmux with a predefined session and window, you can use the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tmux new-session -d -s mySession -n myWindow
tmux send-keys -t mySession:myWindow "cd /my/directory" Enter
tmux send-keys -t mySession:myWindow "vim" Enter
tmux attach -t mySession:myWindow
```

Replace `/my/directory` with the desired directory path. This script creates a new detached session named `mySession` with a window named `myWindow`. It changes to the specified directory and opens the Vim editor. Finally, it attaches to the session and window.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., `start-tmux.sh`), make it executable (`chmod +x start-tmux.sh`), and run it (`./start-tmux.sh`).

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `tmux.conf` file according to your preferences. You can add or remove keybindings, adjust colors, or enable/disable specific features to suit your needs.
